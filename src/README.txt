INSTRUCTIONS:
- Welcome to Place-its.
- Access two awesome buttons on the Action Bar:
     - The PLUS button takes you to a window where you can add a new
       Place-it.
     - The MAP button takes you to a window where you can look around
       a map to see where all of your current Place-its are. Tap on a
       Place-it to see more information about it.
- Hold down on a list item to access a context menu where you may
  move the selected list item to a different list, snooze it, or
  delete it.
- Swipe horizontally between lists to move around the app like a
  speedy ninja.
